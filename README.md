// peer review: Elizar Garcia, Code works great! The game loops as needed and it has data validation. The game also keeps the right guessing amount. The code is easy to read and follow. The orginization is clean and on point. I really like the comments that are above some of the coding, really helps simplify thing. Very well done!
